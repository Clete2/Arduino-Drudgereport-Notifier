RTTTL.pde is an example given by the Arduino team and I have no ownership or responsibility for it.

Setup directions:
1) Set up Arduino.
- Install Ethernet shield
- Install LCD
- Install buzzer

2) Place PHP file on an accessible server.
- Change the byte server[] in DrudgeHeadline.pde to reflect the IP address of your server.
- Change the GET command in DrudgeHeadline.pde to pull your PHP file.

3) Change IP and MAC information in DrudgeHeadline.pde

4) Change all SMTP information in smtp.pde
- Username and password should be encoded using base 64.
- Server information, from email, and to email are needed.
- The script does not support encryption. Use a SMTP server that allows plain text to be used.

5) Choose your favorite song in RTTTL.pde

6) Enjoy.
